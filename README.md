A lexical translator from python syntax to coffeescript syntax.

This is intended merely as a syntactic helper. It has no real smarts.

- A one-day prototype. Inspired by DrobBox's sprint.
- How to use it.
- Why it might be important.
- Discuss problems recreating tokens from parse tree.
- Based on Leo's beautifier, which is solid.
- It would be possible to use a real peephole if required.
